## Guide: Build out a Diner Menu using JavaScript
---

### Task
Build out a Diner menu in JAVASCRIPT. Here are your instructions to build that Diner.

#### Bottega Diner:
- [x] Have the Main Menu and a Sides Menu
- [x] You get one entree and two side choices at regular cost.

> Assumption made: Costumer can order as many sides as they wish but they need to order at least two to get the menu deal. If they order more than two sides, the two most expensive are included in the menu and the costumer pays the extra cost of remaining sides. 

- [x] show them the entire menu (print out)

> Assumption: The code use the function `prompt()` to interact with the user. 

- [x] A user selects an entree.
- [x] “Waitress” makes a comment based on their selection
- [x] comment can either be a comparison of the two items, or random comment pulled from a comment vault.
- [x] Tell them the price
- [x] repeat the above options for side choices (comment and a price)
- [x] total up the cost

### BONUS
- [x] Have breakfast, lunch, and dinner menu. Breakfast has different items, lunch and dinner have the same items but at different prices.

> Assumption made: the menu being shown to the costumer depends on the time the script runs. The restaurant opens at 8am and breakfast is served until 1 pm. Lunch is then served until 8 pm. Dinner is served from 8 pm until to 12 pm. The kitchen is closed from 12 pm to 8 am.  

> Assumption made: The standard price for the lunch and dinner menu are 12 and 20 €, respectively. The main and sides menu are the same but the prices of the dishes is 50% more for dinner. 

### BONUS:
- [x] Allow for item customization (how items are prepared, decide additional cost implications)

> Assumptions made: A customization menu is implemented. Each customization has its own price and each dish can be customized until the costumer is happy. The customization items have a cost which is added to the bill.
